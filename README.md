# Jets

## Description
	- Create a fleet of jets with different capabilities
	- Create a menu to use your jets & access information about them.
	- All jets must have a model, speed (in MPH), range, & price
	- Jets have a "fly" method that prints out the jet details & calculates
	  the amount of time the jet can fly before it runs out of fuel
	- Create a menu of user options to list the current animals, add an animal, feed the animals, or exit the program.

## Technologies Used
	- Java
	- Eclipse
	- Sublime
	- Git/GitHub
	- MacOS Terminal
	- UML Diagrams

## Lessons Learned
	- Always commit your work so that it saves
	- Used & re-inforced learning classes & subclasses
	- Used multiple classes to run the program
	- Used getters & setters, fields, constructors, polymorphism, & toStrings

## To Run the Program
	-

## Changes Made
	- Refined User Experience with verbiage and formatting
	- Changed "double" for price to "long" & all corresponding class instances of "double"
	- Corrected class misspelling of "Invicible" to "Invincible" that was causing errors
	- Started with a do/while loop, but ran into unforeseen errors I couldn't fix so
	  I changed it to a while loop
